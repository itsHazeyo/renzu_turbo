#Forced induction system
Add Horsepowah to your car

# Feat
- While I was only trying to make it reduce the Horsepower back to "Pre-boost" levels once you let go if the gas... I some how enabled "BoostLag", meaning now you will     have to get the rpm above a certain point in-order to get the boost out of your Renzu-turbo. just like big turbo cars! lol ~itsHazeyo
- Now that I have a bit more knowledge of the RAGE engine I was able to replicate superchargers too!
- Disabled the sounds due to my server having custom car sounds
- Designed for the Migdnight Club Unlimited Handling mod ~itsHazeyo
